# A humble Material 3-inspired React Components Library
---
<br></br>
### Info
This is the small library I developed for my test projects with React. There are still a lot of components to be added to it, but I'm working on it!
&nbsp;

The individual features of each component are in its stories pages. Soon I'll publish the palette I've used: key colors are teal (primary), grey (secondary) and pink (tertiary), while the neutral surface tone is a light beige.
